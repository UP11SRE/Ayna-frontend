### A Real-Time Chat App

This Project is a dynamic web application built with React that fosters real-time communication through a websocket-powered chat room.

# Important Note: Due to server optimization strategies, the backend might exhibit a slight delay (up to 1 minute) during the initial application load. This occurs because the backend server temporarily suspends operations during periods of inactivity. Subsequent interactions will experience faster response times.

# Key Features:

- Seamless Communication: Experience instant message exchange using Socket.IO, ensuring your conversations flow effortlessly. Every message you send is echoed back to you, creating a smooth and interactive experience.
- Secure Login: Ayna prioritizes user privacy. To join the chat room, registration and login are mandatory. This ensures only authorized users can participate, fostering a safe and secure environment.
- Personalized Identity: Each registered user retains their unique username within the chat room, allowing for clear identification and personalized interactions.

# Getting Started:

- Clone the Repository: Grab your copy of the Ayna codebase using Git.
- Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary tools by running yarn install.
- Build for Production: Prepare the application for deployment with yarn build.
- Start the Development Server: Launch Ayna locally at http://localhost:3000 using yarn start. This allows you to test and refine the application before deployment.

# Deployment:

- The Ayna frontend is currently hosted at: https://ayna-frontend.onrender.com.
- The backend component resides at: https://ayna-backend-04qn.onrender.com.
